## Dashboard Features
### 1. **Summary Dashboard**
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Total Loan Applications: **38.6K**.
  - Total Funded Amount: **$435.8M**.
  - Total Amount Received: **$473.1M**.
  - Average Interest Rate: **12%**.
  - Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): **13.3%**.
- **Good vs. Bad Loans**:
  - Good Loans: **86.2%** of total, with $435.8M funded and $370.2M repaid.
  - Bad Loans: **13.8%**, with $65.5M funded and $37.3M repaid.

### 2. **Overview Dashboard**
- **Loan Trends**:
  - Steady growth in loan applications from January (**2.3K**) to December (**4.3K**).
- **Geographic Distribution**:
  - Interactive map showcasing loan applications by state.
- **Payment Terms**:
  - Segmentation of loans into 36-month and 60-month terms.
- **Borrower Profiles**:
  - Applications categorized by employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership status.

### 3. **Detailed Dashboard**
- **Tabular View**:
  - Comprehensive data table including fields like loan purpose, home ownership type, grade, sub-grade, issue date, loan amount, interest rate, and repayment details.
- **Interactive Filters**:
  - Filter data by state, grade, or loan purpose for granular insights.

## Key Insights
1. **Loan Performance**:
   - Majority of loans are classified as good loans (**86.2%**) with a positive repayment trend.
   - Bad loans constitute **13.8%**, indicating areas for risk mitigation.
2. **Loan Purpose Analysis**:
   - Debt consolidation is the top reason for loans (**18K applications**), followed by credit card refinancing (**5K**).
3. **Borrower Trends**:
   - Most borrowers are renters or have mortgages.
   - Borrowers with over 10 years of employment have the highest loan application count (**8.9K**).
